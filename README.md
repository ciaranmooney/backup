My backup stratergy for home laptop.

TODO
--
* Create a backup user on both the laptop and pi so the NFS can share it, see
[http://nfs.sourceforge.net/nfs-howto/ar01s07.html#pemission_issues] for why
* Cron needs to run as backup user
* Create and securely store a GPG key (ie offline, printout). The key will be
backed up in an encrypted file. If the key is lost from the laptop, recovery
will not be possible
